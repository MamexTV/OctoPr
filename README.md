# All3DP-OctoPrint-Ubuntu
Elliot Johnson-Hall's Code for All3DP

The code within this repository is based off of the excellent OctoPrint Setup Guide by Gina Häußge. You can find this here: https://community.octoprint.org/t/setting-up-octoprint-on-a-raspberry-pi-running-raspberry-pi-os-debian/2337

There is also a slight modification to the code by the OctoPrint maintainers here: https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/tree/master/scripts
